We are in search of volunteers for our project. If you'd like to donate your voice, fill out this [Google Form](https://imminent.translated.com/research-grants-ceremony-innovations-in-language-technology).

Here's the description at the beginning of the form:

This project seeks to use the voice of volunteer Yorùbá speakers to create a corpus that can be used to create open-sourced language technology projects like voice assistants, screen readers, or other Artificial Intelligence voices (like Siri or Google Assistant) for Yorùbá. By agreeing to participate, you will be helping us achieve this objective of making Yorùbá language more available on the internet in language tech spaces. This project is sponsored by a grant from Imminent-Translated (more [here](https://imminent.translated.com/research-grants-ceremony-innovations-in-language-technology)).

We will need only about an hour of your time for this project.

Volunteers must be in Lagos, because that is where the recordings will take place.

Please answer the following questions and we will reach out to you when we are ready to begin. Every selected volunteer will get a small token of our appreciation.

If you have any more questions about the project, please write us at [project@yorubaname.com](mailto:project@yorubaname.com)
